<h3>System Introduction</h3>
<p>The information system I chose to analyze is the District of Columbia public library (DCPL). It is my local library system that I use on a regular basis and love. The DC public library was created in 1896 by an act of Congress and was located in Andrew Carnegie's home. This was until Carnegie funded to build the Carnegie Library in Mount Vernon Square. While it is unclear when the DCPL started using a website, it can be estimated around early 2000s. The system underwent major renovations in 2009 and most recently as May 2023 to accommodate new and growing users.</p>

<p>Most public libraries in the US only cater to their local community while the DCPL has a much wider reach due to reciprocity with Maryland and Virginia along with offering library cards to non-residents for $20 a year. This results in many users worldwide and local to DC each looking for and needing a myriad of resources. Some of the main highlights on the DCPL front page include how to find and borrow materials, how to conduct research, and events happening in the area. For most users, those three topics are likely the reason for using DCPL.</p>

<p> With your library card, you can create an account on the DCPL website which allows you to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>place books on hold</li>
	<li>reserve research spaces</li>
	<li>gain free access to online sources usually locked behind a paywall</li>
</ol>

<p>The list goes on about all DCPL has to offer and the website is very easily navigable and user friendly. If you search a term, word, or author, the system provides you with accurate and diverse search results. You can also do more advanced searches based on what type of materials you are looking for.</p>

<h3>System Discussion:</h3>
<p>One of my favorite features of the DCPL website is how easy it is to find instructions or get help. Under every main tab there is either a video tutorial, quick links, or a chat bot to help you navigate the website. This makes the website very user friendly for those unfamiliar with this type of technology. This largely demonstrates that when building the system, DCPL prioritized training users and the evaluation part of the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC). I would be interested to learn other aspects of the SDLC while DCPL was developing the new 2023 system. What problems or information was missing prior, what did the previous website look like, what were the bugs, etc?</p>
<p>The system and interface design is really nice and visually appealing. It is clear they spent a lot of time when developing the new interface on design and user experience. However, where they could improve is in the long-term evaluation element of the SDLC. DCPL needs to be incorporating new and evolving technology and making sure their website stays current. Sometimes when looking for newer books and materials or conducting research on current events, they have very few or no resources. DCPL could benefit from having a team consistently updating the website and ordering and providing resources on current events.</p>
<p>One of the features I really like is the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) help bot which is very mindful of the local DC users. As someone who works for the federal government in DC with the National Archives, I encounter a lot of people needing FOIA help. I love that the library is a local resource that can help people navigate that system since it is not easy. It is clear DCPL knows their users well and caters to their needs. In addition to the FOIA bot, a great feature would be a link to help people set up meetings with experts or librarians so someone could directly help them with FOIA or other user systems in person. I know a lot of people who cannot necessarily navigate online forums and a button with a “schedule an appointment with a librarian or FOIA expert” would be really beneficial to marginalized groups.</p>
<p>For modern day, the DCPL system is one of the best local library interfaces I have seen. It is clear they have proper funding and are tapped into their community. As times change and technology changes, they will likely need to go through another SDLC process. For now, their system is very robust and as a frequent user, I can attest to its completeness. In the future I would like to see quicker access to current materials and more experts able to help users directly. Otherwise, I am excited to keep accessing and using my local library alongside the other citizens who made 3 million visits to a DCPL location and contributed to checking out more than 7 million materials in 2023.</p>
